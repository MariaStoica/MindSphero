This app connects Neurosky's MindWave Mobile with Orbotix's Sphero ball.

How it works?

1. Download and install the app on your iPad or iPhone. (it doesn't work on the emulator)
2. Connect Mind Wave and Sphero to your device through bluetooth.
3. Open the app and wait until the 2 icons in the upper right corner turn blue (for Sphero) and green (for MindWave Mobile)
4. The round pegs on the two bars will start moving, mapping your attention and your blink strength. Hold your attention on the green area of the bar for at least 3 seconds to get Sphero to move forward. Blinking strongly enough will make Sphero turn right 90 degrees from its current orientation. Blink softly (normally) to stop turning right.
5. Keep practicing controlling your attention and blinking. After a while you can actually get to controll them pretty accurately. Have fun!
